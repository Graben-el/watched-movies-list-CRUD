# About the Project

This is my first project using Firebase Database to store and do the basic operations such as reading, adding, updating and deleting a collection of movies the user has already watched so far. 

I'm implementing it using React.JS and its resources like styled-components, context api, react-router-dom.

# Features I intend to implement

<ul>
    <li>1 - Basics function of a regular CRUD using Firebase
    <li>2 - A layout for displaying the collection of movies using React JS
    <li>3 - A login system to create unique accounts
    <li>4 - Link user to specific collection that can be manipulated only when logged in
</ul>
